# Mapzza
Created by Mike Santos and Nick Arcaro

Created a JavaScript web application as a final project for the first Rich Media and Web Application Development class at RIT. The application allows a user to look at pizza places and their information around a specific location. This application was created by utilizing the Yelp and Mapbox APIs along with vanilla JavaScript. The user can set their home location that will be stored in local storage (will be saved next time the project is opened in the same browser), click on pizza places to view their public details (according to Yelp), and search for pizza places based upon a certain rating. The application can be utilized here: https://people.rit.edu/mjs8837/330/project3/
